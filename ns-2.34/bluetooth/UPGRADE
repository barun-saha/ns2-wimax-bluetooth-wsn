Having a good understanding of the installation process helps when you 
want to perform a upgrading instead of fresh re-installation.  
The installation process takes the following steps:

1. make symbolic link 'bluetooth -> ucbt-xxx'.
2. apply patches to ns source code.  These patches are for ns source code 
   itself, not particularly for ucbt.
3. replace several ns source files modified by ucbt in bluetooth/ns-2.xx/.
   Orignal ns files are renamed and replaced by linking to the files in
   ucbt's folder.  This simplifies the synchronization with my CVS tree since
   every file is in ucbt's folder.
4. ns's install script is invoked to perform the installation.

I have following suggestions about the upgrading process.

1. If the change is small, do a 'make' in ucbt-xxx/ is fine.
2. If new files are added or some files are deleted, you need to update
   the file Makefile.in, then in 'ns-allinone-xxx/ns-xxx', perform a 
   './configure' to generate the new Makefile.  If you are using 
   cygwin, you need to run 
   './configure --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib --x-includes=/usr/X11R6/include' 
   instead.  If you want the -g flag, edit Makefile to add it.
   Then run 'make'.  If changes are extensive, espcially, header files are
   changed, you need to do a 'make clean' before 'make'. 'make clean' 
   in dir 'ns-allinone-xxx/ns-xxx' will rebuild ns completely. 'make clean' in 
   dir 'bluetooth/' or 'ucbt-xxx/' is just fine most of time.
3. If additional ns source files are changed, you need to update the 
   script 'link-ns.sh' in bluetooth/ns-2.xxx/ and run it before 2.
4. A fresh re-installation should always works.
